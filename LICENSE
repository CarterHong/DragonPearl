This a simple 2D game. It is a Chinese style single-player game of physical ball rolling. The mobile phone's gravity sensor can be used to control the ball moving in the maze.

Game Introduction
This project is developed independently by me. In the beginning of the project, I do market research. Many adults have played Rolling Ball Maze in their childhood. So I want to develop this kind of game. I work as a project manager, programmer, UI designer, game planner and test engineer.

How to play the game ?
The dragon in the middle of the maze is the target. Roll the iPhone and balls using gravity. When both balls roll into the dragon, you win!
