# DragonPearl
This a simple 2D game. It is a Chinese style single-player game of physical ball rolling. The mobile phone's gravity sensor can be used to control the ball moving in the maze.

# Game Introduction
This project is developed independently by me. In the beginning of the project, I do market research. Many adults have played Rolling Ball Maze in their childhood. So I want to develop this kind of game. I work as a project manager, programmer, UI designer, game planner and test engineer.

# How to play the game ?
The dragon in the middle of the maze is the target. Roll the iPhone and balls using gravity. When both balls roll into the dragon, you win!
